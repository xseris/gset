CVE-2016-0778	DoS Overflow	4.6	The (1) roaming_read and (2) roaming_write functions in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2, when certain proxy and forward options are enabled, do not properly maintain connection file descriptors, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by requesting many forwardings.
CVE-2016-0777	+Info	4.0	The resend_bytes function in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2 allows remote servers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by requesting transmission of an entire buffer, as demonstrated by reading a private key.
CVE-2014-1692	DoS Overflow Mem. Corr.	7.5	The hash_buffer function in schnorr.c in OpenSSH through 6.4, when Makefile.inc is modified to enable the J-PAKE protocol, does not initialize certain data structures, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger an error condition.
CVE-2010-5107	DoS	5.0	The default configuration of OpenSSH through 6.1 enforces a fixed time limit between establishing a TCP connection and completing a login, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) by periodically making many new TCP connections.
